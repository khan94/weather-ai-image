1. make sure to store order Id of previously generated image somewhere in the app, and use it as initial state when loading page
2. Instead of 1 image, be able to handle an array of images?
3. currently calling weather API 2 times, because first is based on hardcoded lat and lng and, second is based on current location. Need to fix that
4. Handle error cases when APIs fail for both weather API and AI image APIs
